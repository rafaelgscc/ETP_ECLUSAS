\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
   Locks are systems that work as elevators for moving vessels in both directions on a river. For better control, a supervisory system is essential for monitoring the entire plant. In this context, the use of an industrial protocol such as MODBUS, the use of the ESP32 controller and an open source supervisory system SCADABR are quite beneficial, since in addition to being widely used in industries, they are easy to manipulate and control by operators and engineers. This work will address the implementation of a supervisory system in a lock, and all the electronics behind the implementation, as well as a prototype for paradigm testing. The first part will address concepts about what a lock is and the technologies that comprise it. Soon after, technologies to be implemented, results and recommendations for engineers and lock operators will be discussed.
